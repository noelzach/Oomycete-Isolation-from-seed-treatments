# Valent-Isolation-Manuscript

This project was aimed at trying to understand how seed treatments influence oomycete isolation success and failure (i.e., reducing infection). Additionally, we wanted to know if seed treatments are more active in the lateral roots or taproot. Thirdly, we wanted to know if oomycetes isolated from mefenoxam treated seed were less sensitive to mefenoxam and if they were controled by ethaboxam. 

Therefore, we broke the analysis into two parts. 
1. is data and code associated with isolation successes and failures 
2. is data and code associated with fungicide sensitivity. 

All files and data can be found in these directories.
