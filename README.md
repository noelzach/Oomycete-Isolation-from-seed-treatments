# Oomycete-Isolation-from-seed-treatments

Manuscript about isolation of oomycetes from soybean roots treated with oomicides

The questions we were trying to answer with this manuscript were: 
1. Do we isolate oomycetes more frequently from lateral roots or stem tissue?
2. Does the presence of mefenoxam or metalaxyl + ethaboxam reduce this probability, and on which tissue? 
3. Are oomycetes cultured from mefenoxam treated seed less sensitive to mefenoxam? 
4. What is the variation in sensitivity across species and within species to mefenoxam and ethaboxam? 

Therefore, I have broken down the analysis into two parts. 
 1. Part one is analysis using a binomial model to predict the probability of isolation successes given differnt factors
    This is contained within the GitHub/IsolationFrequency.Rmd file 
 2. Part two is dose response analysis of oomycete isolates. 
    this is contained within the GitHub/ValentIsolationFungicideSensitivity.Rmd file
